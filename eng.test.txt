Afew days ago, I stumbled upon a news item that broke my brain. “Disney Explores the Sale of More Films and TV Series to Rivals,” Bloomberg reported on Feb. 3, citing anonymous sources who said that the entertainment monolith was considering licensing some of its original content to outside platforms “as pressure grows to curb the losses in its streaming TV business.” This might sound like a pretty quotidian showbiz story, but here’s the thing: Disney’s new thinking—which CEO Bob Iger confirmed in an earnings call on Wednesday—directly contradicts the longstanding industry consensus that the best way for a studio to monetize its content is to hoard it all on its own subscription streaming platform. This is, in fact, the conventional wisdom that begat our current overabundance of subscription streaming platforms.
Disney isn’t the first major entertainment company to challenge this basic assumption of the streaming wars in recent months. Warner Bros. Discovery executed the same kind of pivot in December, pulling several titles off HBO Max with plans to license them to free, ad-supported TV (FAST) providers like Roku, Freevee, and Tubi. If the immediate effect of the latter decision was mass panic over the sudden disappearance of Westworld, then the more salient implication of the Warner and Disney stories—not just for the industry, but for viewers—is that executives facing huge losses now appear to be questioning everything they thought they knew about their business. In other words: the streaming wars have entered their chaos era.
Disney’s reversal on licensing is, after all, only the latest in an onslaught of puzzling and, at times, alarming news from the sector. Let’s review some of the biggest bafflers: The December HBO Max disappearances continued a rolling bloodbath at the newly merged Warner Bros. Discovery that began over the summer, as the company’s new CEO, David Zaslav, purged a long list of originals from the platform and scrapped completed seasons of well-liked series including TBS’s Chad and Max’s Minx. (WBD also shelved movies like Batgirl, which was already in post-production at the time.) Both shows were soon salvaged by other streamers, with Chad’s second season airing on the Roku Channel and Starz picking up Minx. Meanwhile, in November, Disney brought in its former longtime leader Iger to replace his own replacement, Bob Chapek. And just last week, Netflix unveiled its plan to crack down on password sharing—but then, amid swift subscriber backlash, the company deleted the most controversial details from its U.S. Help Center, claiming it had not intended to post them there.
Then there are the more standard cancellations, which of course are nothing new for TV, but which were rarer in the early streaming era and now seem to be happening at a greater frequency than ever. HBO’s Los Espookys, Amazon’s As We See It, Showtime’s Flatbush Misdemeanors, Max’s Made for Love, and AMC+’s Moonhaven are just a few of the standout shows that got slashed last year, just a season or two into their runs. And now, mere month into 2023, the axe has already fallen on several promising debut series, from FX’s long-awaited Octavia E. Butler adaptation Kindred to Hulu’s star-studded meta-sitcom Reboot to The Chair, a Netflix dramedy that put Sandra Oh at the center of campus intrigue, along with inferior titles (HBO Max’s halfhearted Gossip Girl reboot, Showtime’s ill-conceived American Gigolo sequel). The cancellations of cult favorites like Amazon’s The Wilds and Netflix’s Warrior Nun and First Kill—all of which center young, queer women—have sparked fan outrage and pleas for other platforms to save the shows. At the same time, renewals of soulless reboots like Netflix’s That ’90s Show and announcements of absurd-sounding franchises like Showtime’s new Billions universe (who’s excited for Millions and Trillions?) don’t inspire much confidence that streamers remain invested in quality programming.
Like just about every unpopular decision made by for-profit companies, the reasoning behind the vast majority of these moves surely comes down to money. Indeed, from a financial perspective, streaming is in an increasingly tough spot. As Iger noted on Wednesday, amid news that Disney would lay off 7,000 employees despite beating revenue forecasts: “The streaming business … is not delivering basically the kind of profitability or bottom line results that the linear business delivered.” (AMC Networks chairman James Dolan made a similar comment in a grim memo to staff this past November: “It was our belief that cord cutting losses would be offset by gains in streaming. This has not been the case.”) The content arms race that Netflix kicked off in the 2010s put enormous pressure on even the most prosperous corporate parents to launch in-house streaming platforms and grow their audiences through massive original-content spends.
Streamers haven’t just been pumping out more shows than linear could ever have supported; they’re also dropping unprecedented sums on individual titles designed to cut through the noise they created and attract new subscribers. But in a TV landscape no longer standardized by Nielsen ratings and the advertiser dollars they represent, where raw viewership numbers are only one piece of the metrics puzzle, it’s tougher than ever to judge any given title’s success. Did Amazon’s billion-dollar Lord of the Rings bet pay off? It depends who you ask.
One takeaway is certain: when it comes to streaming, just about everyone who isn’t Netflix is in the red. And when the industry leader reported significant subscriber losses in the first and second quarters of 2022, Wall Street worried that the era of endless growth had in fact ended, Netflix’s stock plummeted, and a company that had long been determined to run solely on subscriptions introduced an ad-supported tier in November. A year of layoffs and losses in the adjacent tech sector, within a larger U.S. economy haunted by recession talk that was likely just CEO fear-mongering, didn’t help matters.
Listen: I’m not a business reporter or an industry analyst or an MBA. I’m a TV critic who follows and occasionally reports on the streaming business out of personal and professional investment in television as an art form and societal barometer. Beyond hoping the industry remains sustainable enough to keep making shows I like, and to support the people who make them, corporate balance sheets are not my concern. But it seems obvious that when C-suites have revolving doors—Disney’s two Bobs and Iger’s newly announced radical reorganization plan aside, the last year has seen leadership shakeups at Netflix, WBD, Paramount Global, NBC Universal, AMC Networks, Apple TV+, and in Amazon’s media division—while strong series get canned without having a chance to find their audiences and studios are incentivized to trash finished seasons for tax purposes or sell them to competitors instead of airing them, the conditions for creating great television aren’t optimal.
’Twas ever thus, perhaps. TV has always been first and foremost a business. Yet what feels noteworthy here is not the expediency of streaming executives’ decision making; on the contrary, it’s the randomness and uncertainty and outright flailing that seems to surround so many recent strategic shifts. Streaming services like Disney+ and HBO Max were supposed to be, unlike Netflix, permanent libraries for century-old studio archives; now, copyright ownership doesn’t guarantee even recent titles’ availability. For years, Netflix operated on the assumption that enough viewers would pay a premium for an ad-free experience, but then they needed to reach the ones who wouldn’t. Loose password-sharing policies were once thought to help hook young people on services they’d pay for as adults; now, it’s time to crack down. Subscription fees were the only to effectively monetize programming… until licensing, and specifically FAST, apparently became a better option for some of it—which might make you suspect that streaming execs aren’t innovating so much as reverse-engineering the hybrid advertising-subscription model that predominated on cable-era linear, complete with a contemporary form of syndication.
This is what chaos looks like. We don’t know yet which of streaming executives’ many recent, seemingly desperate pivots will be temporary and which we’ll look back on as turning points in the history of TV, for better or worse. But if you listen hard, you can hear echoes of a Y2K-era music industry whose leaders couldn’t wrap their minds around the internet and let upstarts from Napster to Apple erode their revenue streams—and of early-2010s digital publishers chasing Facebook-driven audience growth, who realized too late that Zuckerberg giveth and Zuckerberg taketh away. A decade or two post-cataclysm, these industries are still playing financial catch-up, at the expense of some of their most ambitious voices and projects. While it remains to be seen whether streaming execs have a similarly ravenous appetite for self-destruction, the confusion in the air sure does feel familiar.


Around Washington and in political salons, a favorite guessing game is about what threads of evidence are known to which prosecutors and when—if ever—someone will hold ex-President Donald Trump to account for any number of alleged crimes. We went through it with Robert Mueller’s investigation and two-volume report—and a tell-all book about it, of course, when it was over—which whetted D.C.’s appetite for everyone to suddenly act like they were stars of a Beltway version of the Law & Order franchise.
The latest entry is from Mark Pomerantz, who did what a columnist at The Washington Post put so perfectly as “litigate and tell.” And the veteran lawyer did so with an eruption that caught his former colleagues off guard, likely complicated the case he was ostensibly chasing before a very public resignation, and perhaps gave his swan-song case’s target—former President Donald Trump—an unexpected if ad hominem defense. His incendiary device: a Grisham-esque score-settling tome bound together as People vs. Donald Trump: An Inside Account, which came out Tuesday.
Let’s go back to the start of the tape. Pomerantz was a happily retired former federal prosecutor and criminal defense lawyer, living in the New York suburbs during the heyday of the COVID-19 crisis when his phone rang with a solicitation for him to come in as a part-time, outside adviser to the New York District Attorney’s Office, the front-line local prosecutors in Manhattan. Cyrus Vance Jr., the soon-to-be-outgoing top prosecutor, was looking for some counsel on the case he and his colleagues were building against Trump and his businesses. Federal prosecutors in New York and Washington had their own interests in the same set of facts, and the New York state attorney general was also proceeding along a parallel track. The recruitment of an outside panel of advisers for a local jurisdiction “seemed a bit odd,” but Pomerantz joined—and then escalated.
Pomerantz started poring over case material and eventually won an appointment as an unpaid member of the team of prosecutors. He says he tended to lean into “creative theorizing” and “novel” ideas about potential articles of indictment. But it’s clear he increasingly convinced himself and more than a few others that they could not only build a case against Trump, but they could win. Yet the conservative—with a lower-case C—culture in the city office proved frustrating for Pomerantz, who felt his junior colleagues weren’t listening. And here’s where personalities clashed with facts.
The Pomerantz book has bullet points that aren’t really in dispute. Trump used an intermediary-turned-cooperating witness to pay off an adult film star, an act that Pomerantz weighs as potential extortion from the side of Stormy Daniels but “not illegal in itself” from where Trump sat. Trump was an unrepentant fudger of facts who inflated the value of his properties to secure loans, used dodgy donations of undevelopable land to claim tax deductions, and misled taxing authorities to avoid paying the full bill when it came due, according to Pomerantz’s account, which reads like an unofficial indictment of the former President. (In the official one the New York DA’s office brought against the Trump Organization, jurors found the companies guilty on tax charges, but Trump himself was not indicted.) In one particularly telling piece of Pomerantz’s story, public documents prove Trump wrongly claimed his home in Trump Tower was 30,000 square feet when it actually measures at 11,000.
Ultimately, Pomerantz likens Trump to John Gotti, a former mob boss who used every trick to avoid culpability and maintain one degree of deniability while building a massive criminal enterprise. It’s compelling, to be sure, but amid numerous sprawling criminal investigations and allegations of both personal and financial impropriety, Trump still won the White House in 2016 and captured more votes than any incumbent President in history when he tried to keep it in 2020.
Pomerantz is the first to acknowledge he and his team didn’t always have visibility into what other prosecutors were up to and that his team was vastly understaffed. “We simply did not know all that they had been doing,” he writes, leading to some crossed messages, occasionally unofficial back-channel talks, and frequent competitive jockeying. Internal fights among his team were also aplenty. “A mini-revolt” came that pitted the interlopers with the career prosecutors, there was a tense transition between Vance and his successor, Alvin Bragg, and then Pomerantz and a colleague drafted coordinated resignations to protest Bragg’s slow-walking of the Trump case once he took over the office..
And then he wrote this book, which served his cause well. At least at some point. “Donald Trump had managed to dance between the raindrops of accountability,” Pomerantz laments in a closing chapter. Bragg’s choice, he said, would be proven “historically bad.”
Setting aside the ongoing drama about whether Pomerantz violated a non-disclosure agreement, broke with decades of norms, and sidestepped ethics rules for lawyers in writing this book, the text on its own carries a tranche of caveats. For instance, by his own admission, Pomerantz and Bragg never jelled. They didn’t have the same rapport that Pomerantz, Vance, and his trusted adviser Carey Dunne enjoyed based on decades of professional familiarity if not friendship. By contrast, Pomerantz at one point notes that he was graduating law school when Bragg was born, just one of the asides that leaves a little bit of petty reside on the face of his otherwise meritorious argument.
Pomerantz is never so filled with hubris to assert that his case was a slam-dunk set of facts, but his meticulously detailed retelling leads readers to that conclusion. In fact, according to Pomerantz, even the objectors inside the New York District Attorney’s Office never said they thought Trump was innocent; their protests were about the politicization of a prosecution and what the case—win or lose—would do to the country and its fragile democracy. After all, it’s one thing to catch Trump’s businesses valuing one Manhattan property at $527 million on one paper and then telling tax authorities that it was worth as little as $16 million; it’s another to fret about sparking another Jan. 6, 2021-style uprising by being the first prosecutors in history to indict a former President.
While many of the facts in the book are already known to careful trackers of the Trump legal saga, the behind-the-scenes jostling was only intimated in real time. Thanks to Pomerantz, we now have plenty of—admittedly, self-serving—insights into the choices made to build a case against Trump and then to let it simmer under a new district attorney. Because much of the juiciest evidence had been presented in secret to a grand jury, Pomerantz has to rely on what has already leaked to build his public case. There’s plenty there, for sure, and there are other little nuggets he hints at, both in his writing and the publication of emails and memos sent up the chain of command.
The book’s biggest problem is that it assumed the status quo would hold, and that didn’t happen. The prosecution that Pomerantz sought didn’t come on his timeline, but it appears to be moving forward now, a development that emerged between the manuscript’s submission and its arrival on Washington’s doorstep. There are broad pronouncements to be made here about instant gratification and the merits of its delay, about betraying colleagues’ confidences and taking a messy intra-office squabble public.
But the more germane is the practical: things change, and they change rapidly when the potential defendant is the former—and perhaps future—President of the United States. Now with Pomerantz’s grievances printed, Trump may have more grist for his gripes about “witch hunts” and biased prosecution. Writing a definitive history in real time is difficult, if not impossible. To borrow an analogy from Pomerantz, sometimes it takes a minute to boil an ocean. Pomerantz didn’t like his boss’s pace and took his candle back to the suburbs. What he missed was that perhaps a flamethrower was waiting in the wings of the DA’s office, and his fanning a conflagration from afar was unlikely to be helpful. Which is why it’s entirely likely that Pomerantz, who is hawking his book where he can, may soon find himself helping the P.R. case of the very man he spent a year chasing as a criminal: Trump.
